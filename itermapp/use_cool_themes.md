# Use cool themes

You can spice up your `iTerm.app` terminal with a lot of [different themes][themes], go and check
them out.

## Nord Theme

I use the `Nord` theme, which is a nice theme that is easy on the eyes.

I found a nice colouring scheme for `ls`, a configuration of `dircolors` that works well with the `Nord` theme.

There is also a `Nord` theme for `tmux`, which I use.

- [GitHub: nordtheme/tmux][tmux]

Does require **tpm** for use, see my TIL on [how to use tpm](../tmux/use_tpm.md).

And one for `Vim`, which I also use.

- [GitHub: nordtheme/vim][vim]

Does require **vim-plug** for use, see my TIL on [how to use vim-plug](../vim/use_vimplug.md) and do note I ran into [a problem](../vim/cannot_install_vim_plugin.md) with the repository name.
