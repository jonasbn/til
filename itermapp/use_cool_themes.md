# Use cool themes

You can spice up your `iTerm.app` terminal with a lot of [different themes][themes], go and check
them out.

## Nord Theme

I use the `Nord` theme, which is a nice theme that is easy on the eyes.

I found a nice colouring scheme for `ls`, a configuration of `dircolors` that works well with the `Nord` theme.

There is also a `Nord` theme for `tmux`, which I use.
