# Use posting

I recently came across **posting**, a very cool HTTP client for the terminal.

It let's you organize a set of requests, so you can easily navigate these.

**posting** can be installed via `uv` (another cool tool).

```shell
# install Posting (will also quickly install Python 3.13 if needed)
uv tool install --python 3.13 posting
```

And if you want to upgrade **posting** at some point:

```shell
uv tool upgrade posting
```
