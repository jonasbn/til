# Update when the exercise has been updated

If you have an existing exercise, but the exercise has been updated with [Exercism], you can do:

```bash
exercism download --force --track=<track> --exercise=<exercise>
```

For example:

```bash
exercism download --force --track=go --exercise=booking-up-for-beauty
```

Where you would normally do a:

```bash
exercism download --track=<track> --exercise=<exercise>
```

When downloading an exercise the first time.

I always to a `git init` in my exercise folders, so I can use basic version control, branches and what not - all the nice stuff.
