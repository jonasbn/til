# Use Verbs

Use the _verbs_ specified for the HTTP protocol to get the most our of you HTTP based API.

The _verbs_ are more correctly named: HTTP request methods and the term _verbs_ is also widely used.

- `POST` for creation
- `GET` for reading
- `PUT` for complete updating or replacing
- `PATCH` for partial updating or modifying
- `DELETE` for deletion

If you, _like me_ cannot remember, which of the _verbs_ does what, like `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` you can use these simple rules of thumb, the first one I got from a colleague:

> The `U` in `PUT` is for _update_

And now for one I had to make for myself:

> Post is always delivered at the gate, so when thinking about `POST`, remember gate rhymes with _create_...

And the last one is for `PATCH`, if you are RESTful

> `PATCH` can do a partial update compared to `PUT` so "PAT" is short for _partial_...
