# Using Light and Dark Themes

You can specify light and dark themes for the Ghostty terminal emulator in the configuration file.

```text
theme = dark:nord,light:Builtin Solarized Light
```

> When separate light and dark themes are specified, Ghostty will automatically switch between the light and dark theme based on the system appearance.
>

To see available themes, run the following command:

```bash
ghostty +list-themes
```
