# Ghostty Visor

**Ghostty** has a nifty feature of a terminal window you can access easily even if **Ghostty** is not the active applicatio, I believe this is called a visor - and it seems to originate from the Quake terminal, where you have this overlay terminal you can access with a key combination at all times.

- ["Request: Quake-style (Visor) Overlay Terminal Mode"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/3733).

So if **Ghostty** is running, I have an easily accessible terminal (visor).

I have mapped this to: `<shift>`-`<command>`-`<t>`.

The feature is called quick terminal - and it is very very useful.
