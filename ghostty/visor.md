# Ghostty Visor

*Ghostty* has a nifty feature of a terminal window you can access easily even if *Ghostty* is not the active application.

I have mapped this to: `<shift>`-`<command>`-`<t>`.

So if *Ghostty* is running, I have an easily accessible terminal (visor). The feature is called quick terminal, but I have seen it referred to as a visor from other applications and in the requests for the feature in *Ghostty*.
