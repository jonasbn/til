# Use CLI

For easy and fast GitHub interaction use the official GitHub command line tool `[gh](https://cli.github.com/)`.

`gh` lets you do about everything you can do in the UI at least for the day to day work.

I can also be extended using [_extensions_][GHEXTLIST]

Install an extension:

```bash
gh extension install dlvhdr/gh-prs
```

You can list your installed extensions:

```bash
$ gh extension list
gh prs  dlvhdr/gh-prs
```

And then you can use the extension:

```bash
gh prs
```
