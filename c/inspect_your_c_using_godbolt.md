# Inspect your C using Godbolt

Heard about this on [Programming Throwdown podcast episode 155][EPISODE155].

I am not a C-programmer at all, but that does not mean that I am not impressed with this tool. I have not idea about it's practical use and value, but I guess it could be useful learning or debugging C code (when you are a C programmer/newbie).
