# Using Light and Dark Themes

In the Zed configuration file, you can specify a `light` and `dark` theme to use for the editor. The themes are specified in the `theme` section of the configuration file.

In addition you can set the mode to: `system` to follow the system setting.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "system",
    "light": "One Light",
    "dark": "One Dark"
  }
}
```
