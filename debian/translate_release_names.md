# Translate Release Names

The Debian release names are probably easy to remember for people working with them every day, but for me, the occasional Debian acquaintance, I need help.

I located [this resource][debianreleases], so I can look up the releases and their in order in particular

- Debian 12 _Bookworm_
- Debian 11 _Bullseye_
- Debian 10 _Buster_
- Debian 9 _Stretch_
- Debian 8 _Jessie_
- Debian 7 _Wheezy_
- Debian 6 _Squeeze_
