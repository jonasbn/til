# Explainshell.com

Awesome website that explains shell commands.

- [Explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/)

Example:

- `https://www.explainshell.com/explain?cmd=cat+urls.txt+%7C+xargs+-n+1+curl+-O+-L#`

From the front page you can enter a command and it will explain what each part of the command does.

Do note it has limits and do not know commands like  `jq` etc.

Bonus! it supports both dark and light themes.
