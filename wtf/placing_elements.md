# Placing Elements

The wtfutil uses a grid when placing elements. This is a visual representation of the grid, just to make it easier to understand.

|   |   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| L | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |
| E | 1 |   |   |   |   |   |
| F | 2 |   |   |   |   |   |
| T | 3 |   |   |   |   |   |

This resembles the 4th. quadrant in the cartesian coordinate system, but all the numbers are positive, 0,0 is the top-left corner.
