# Comments

Comments in PHP are different.

PHP suports:

- `#`
- `//`

For single lines and:

- `/* */`

For multi lines.

The multi line comments cannot be nested.

The single line comments work both from the beginning of a line and from their position to the end of a line

Comments outside: `<?php ... ?>` are printed, comments inside `<?php ... ?>` are not.
