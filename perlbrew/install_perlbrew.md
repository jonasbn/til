# Install Perlbrew

I love **Perlbrew** for all of the reasons mentioned on the **Perlbrew** website, the order has been changed to my preference:

- Leave vendor perl (the one that comes with OS) alone
- No need to run sudo to install CPAN modules, any more
- Test your production code against different perl versions.
- Try the monthly released new perls
- Learn new language features

```bash
$ sudo cpan App::perlbrew
$ perlbrew init
```
