# Use nodenv

`nodenv` is similar to:

- `virtualenv` for Python
- `rbenv` for Ruby
- `rvm` also for Ruby
- `plenv` for Perl
- `perlbrew` also for Perl

And of course:

- `nvm`

Which is also for NodeJS.

It lets use install several Node versions in parallel. Which has several benefits:

- You do not have to rely on a system controlled and installed toolchain
- You can possibly specify specific versions for projects/repositories
- It is very easy to reinstall if something goes _haywire_
