# XSLT-processor

As mentioned also in the [TIL on learning XSLT](../xslt/learn_xslt.md).

For NodeJS/JavaScript:

In regards to JavaScript implementation:

- [xslt][xslt]
- [xslt-processor][xslt-processor]

The first one is not actively maintained, the latter should be used.

A cool this about [xslt-processor][xslt-processor] is that it does not rely on external libraries AFAICT.
