# How to install dependencies from package-lock.json

Normally you would install dependencies using the `npm install` command. This command will install the dependencies from the `package.json` file. This file contains the dependencies that are required for the application to run.

The `package-lock.json` file is a file generated by npm to lock down the versions of the dependencies that are installed. This file is used to ensure that the same versions of dependencies are installed on all machines that are used to develop and run the application.

Using this as base for an installation is quite easy. Just run the following command:

```bash
npm ci
```

This will install the dependencies from the `package-lock.json` file. If the file does not exist, it will fail.

The cousin of `npm` is `yarn`. Yarn has a similar command to install dependencies from a lock file:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```
