# Translate Release Names

The Ubuntu release names are probably easy to remember for people working with them every day, but for me, the occasional Ubuntu user, I need help.

I located [this resource][ubuntureleases], so I can look up the releases and their in order in particular

- Ubuntu 22 _Jammy_ (Jammy Jellyfish)
- Ubuntu 20 _Focal_ (Focal Fossa)
- Ubuntu 18 _Bionic_ (Bionic Beaver)
- Ubuntu 16 _Xenial_ (Xenial Xerus)
- Ubuntu 14 _Trusty_ (Trusty Tahr)
