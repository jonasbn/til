# Light and Dark mode

macOS support switching between light and dark mode. This is a system-wide setting that can be changed in the System Preferences or via the command line.

I have collected some notes on various tools you can set to follow the system setting:

- [Ghostty](ghostty/using_light_and_dark_themes.md)
- [VSCode](vscode/using_light_and_dark_themes.md)
- [Zed](zed/using_light_and_dark_themes.md)

Applications and websites that still bug me are:

- Google Calendar
- Google Mail

To switch between light and dark mode from the command line, see my specific TIL:
